# AdvancedGUI Web Panel

This is the official Web Panel to create layouts for the AdvancedGUI-System. In it's core it is a graphic editor using Vue and HTML5 Canvas. The panel depends on a minimum of other resources to keep it simple and lightweight.

The code, especially the component and action system, are hightly modular making it very easy to add new and very complex logic with as little code as possible.
